# Overview

This project uses an LLM (via the OpenAI API) to extract commonly asked questions from unstructured text data and automatically creates a Notion page (via the Notion API) to document them.

The Slack message data used in this example was originally extracted using **Fivetran**.  However, the code is **designed to work with any text-based message data**. You can adapt it easily to any dataset containing text conversations (e.g., customer chats, support tickets, forum posts).

# Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need:

- A database or file containing the text message data you want to analyze.
- In this example, the Slack message data (`team_slack`) is loaded from **Google Drive**.  
  âž” You will need to replace this part with your own data loading method, depending on where your messages are stored (e.g., local file, database, cloud storage).
- An **OpenAI API key** for processing and summarizing Slack (or any other text) messages
- A **Notion API integration** and **integration token** for creating a Notion page with the results

ðŸ‘‰ **Important:**  
- You must have a **billed OpenAI account** (free-tier accounts without billing enabled cannot use the API).
- Running this notebook will **incur API costs** based on the number of tokens processed.  
  Costs depend on the size of your Slack message dataset and the OpenAI model you use.
- You can create and manage your OpenAI API key here: [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

- You also need to create a **Notion integration** and get your **Notion integration token**.  
  You can create one here: [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)  
  After creating the integration, don't forget to share the target Notion page with your integration to give it access.

Please make sure you have both API keys ready before running the code.  
You can set them securely as environment variables (recommended) or insert them directly into the code (not recommended for shared environments).

Example environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `NOTION_API_KEY`
